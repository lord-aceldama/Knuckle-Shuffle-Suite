###THE KNUCKLE-SHUFFLE SUITE:
Well, what can i say - if you have time on your hands...  
...The knuckle-shuffle suite is designed to be a more efficient way of brute-forcing a 
keyspace. It consists of the following scripts:
* __knuckleshuffle.py:__ The main script. It sends the generated keys to STDOUT and messages to STDERR.
* __abacus.py:__ Will eventually be incorporated into knuckle-shuffle.py. It's basically just here as a development script.
* __sausage-fest:__ Will be the server script for cloud cracking should you have two or more slaves a-shufflin'.
